# Fall-Detection-Image-Classifier
TensorFlow-based deep learning model that classifies images as either fall or non-fall. The model is designed to assist with computer visionâ€“based fall detection by learning visual patterns associated with human falls. The dataset used for training the model is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elwalyahmad/fall-detection. This was my first time using TensorFlow and my first time working on an image classification project, so I learned a great deal about convolutional neural networks through this project. One major takeaway I gained from this project is the importance of not using too large of a network when the dataset is on the smaller side. Given the training set I used had ~900 images, I had to get creative with data augmentation, use batch normalization, and shrink the number of nodes I had originally to deal with overfitting.
